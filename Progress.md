# Gpu performance metrics.

0. GPU specifications (Done)

1. What is the memory bandwidth/latency from cpu to gpu.
        -> Transferring to global memory. Latency and throughput. (30 min)

2. Understand different levels of multi programming
    # Warp occupancy rate.

3. Random Access throughput to global memory vs tiled access vs same access

4. Shared Memory, Constant Memory.

5. Streams.

6. Atomics.

Final Goals:
1. Tiled Matrix multiplication, transpose.
2. Breadth First Search -  Compare with GunRock.
3. Scatter, Gather
